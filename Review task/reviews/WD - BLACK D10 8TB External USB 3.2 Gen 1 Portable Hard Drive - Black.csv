I use it for storage. I'm into photography and drones. That means lots of photos and videos. The drive is fast! It has a disc speed of 7200 rpm. I purchased two of them to give me ample storage.

Great speed and reliability. Can fit my whole game library off my pc on it. I keep my main games on an ssd and load off the ones I play less to this drive. Would recommended 100%. The only negative would be is that it’s a bit noisy but not all the time. I usually have my headphones on anyways. Grab this if you’ve been looking for a speedy and reliable external hard drive. Works with PC, PS4 and Xbox"

The device aesthetic is very nice and I don't have any complaints about the build.  The advertised read and write speeds are right in line with what Western Digital states are the speeds (see attached picture). I have seen people asking what drive is inside this external ""WD_Black"" series external drive. Well it's not a black series drive (Like the 8TB WD8001FZBX) but an HGST HUS728T8TALE6L4. This is not a bad thing as this is a data center-class hard drive and paying only $15-20 for a nice external enclosure.  Be aware this is not 100% quiet as it is a full-size, higher-performing drive but is not annoying and probably cant be heard from 10 feet away if gaming from a distance. If you need an extremely quiet drive look at the  Western Digital P10 Black series but you are not going to get this performance.  I have to do further testing to see if the drive ever fully ramps down as it does seem like the platters tend to constantly spin just for longevity purposes."

The value lies in the large 8TB capacity, great for storing PS4/5 games.  (It should work equally well with XBox.) I did find it a bit faster than my older USB 3.0 HDD.  It is relatively quiet, although one can hear it spool up and click away. It is not noticeable unless one listens for it. It is also actively cooled with an internal fan and ventilation slots in the housing.  It comes with a stand for holding it verticallly or it can sit horizontally on a flat surface.  At around $200 and 8TB capacity, it’s a good value for a gaming storage HDD."

The advertised read and write speeds are right in line with what Western Digital states are the speeds (see attached picture). I have seen people asking what drive is inside this external ""WD_Black"" series external drive. Well it's not a black series drive (Like the 8TB WD8001FZBX) but an HGST HUS728T8TALE6L4. This is not a bad thing as this is a data center-class hard drive and paying only $15-20 for a nice external enclosure.  Be aware this is not 100% quiet as it is a full-size, higher-performing drive but is not annoying and probably cant be heard from 10 feet away if gaming from a distance. If you need an extremely quiet drive look at the  Western Digital P10 Black series but you are not going to get this performance.

The device aesthetic is very nice and I don't have any complaints about the build.  The advertised read and write speeds are right in line with what Western Digital states are the speeds (see attached picture). I have seen people asking what drive is inside this external ""WD_Black"" series external drive. Well it's not a black series drive (Like the 8TB WD8001FZBX) but an HGST HUS728T8TALE6L4. This is not a bad thing as this is a data center-class hard drive and paying only $15-20 for a nice external enclosure.  Be aware this is not 100% quiet as it is a full-size, higher-performing drive but is not annoying and probably cant be heard from 10 feet away if gaming from a distance. If you need an extremely quiet drive look at the  Western Digital P10 Black series but you are not going to get this performance.  I have to do further testing to see if the drive ever fully ramps down as it does seem like the platters tend to constantly spin just for longevity purposes."

The device aesthetic is very nice and I don't have any complaints about the build.  The advertised read and write speeds are right in line with what Western Digital states are the speeds (see attached picture). I have seen people asking what drive is inside this external ""WD_Black"" series external drive. Well it's not a black series drive (Like the 8TB WD8001FZBX) but an HGST HUS728T8TALE6L4. This is not a bad thing as this is a data center-class hard drive and paying only $15-20 for a nice external enclosure.  Be aware this is not 100% quiet as it is a full-size, higher-performing drive but is not annoying and probably cant be heard from 10 feet away if gaming from a distance. If you need an extremely quiet drive look at the  Western Digital P10 Black series but you are not going to get this performance.

The advertised read and write speeds are right in line with what Western Digital states are the speeds (see attached picture). I have seen people asking what drive is inside this external ""WD_Black"" series external drive. Well it's not a black series drive (Like the 8TB WD8001FZBX) but an HGST HUS728T8TALE6L4. This is not a bad thing as this is a data center-class hard drive and paying only $15-20 for a nice external enclosure.  Be aware this is not 100% quiet as it is a full-size, higher-performing drive but is not annoying and probably cant be heard from 10 feet away if gaming from a distance. If you need an extremely quiet drive look at the  Western Digital P10 Black series but you are not going to get this performance.

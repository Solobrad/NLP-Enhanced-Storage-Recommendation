So shuckers may want to take note. This drive is purchased and tested in February 2021.

Some say that the WD80EDAZ inside this enclosure is actually spinning at 7200 rpm, which it might be since the sequential performance of this drive closely matches that of my Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm.

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups.

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups.

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups.

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups.

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

WD,easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,WD - easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,"Feb 3, 2021 1:28 AM","I got this drive because I needed a bigger and faster drive to do backups but it might get shucked for a NAS in the future. So shuckers may want to take note. This drive is purchased and tested in February 2021.

Some say that the WD80EDAZ inside this enclosure is actually spinning at 7200 rpm, which it might be since the sequential performance of this drive closely matches that of my Seagate Barracuda 7200 rpm.
https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ikk0rv/psa_multiple_wd_5400rpm_drives_are_actually/

On one hand this is WD and their screwed up, misleading marketing (See: SMR drives sold as CMR drives). The other comments complaining that the drives run hot and loud are warranted. This drive is air ""filled"" instead of helium filled like the old ones which adds to the heat this generates. 59 C under heavy load in a 21 C ambient is HOT. It also gets even louder once the head starts moving.

On the other hand, I can live with its compromises for a drive that only needs to run around once a week. The 200 MBps sequential dramatically increased the speed of my backups. But the high temperatures this generates is still a concern. 60 C is usually the maximum operating temperature for mechanical hard drives so if you plan to run this under extended periods of time like in a NAS, it may need active cooling. If you're keeping this drive in its enclosure, keep it vertical so it can passively exhaust its heat through the top vents."

WD,easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,WD - easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,"Jan 21, 2021 8:30 PM","The new WD easystore 8TB version changed the case front and drive inside. 7.27 TB actual usable space. Made in Thailand. The box it came in was not shrink wrapped.

The old, discontinued 8TB version contained a helium filled drive, while these new ones are air filled WD80EDAZ-11TA3A0. The new drive runs hot and loud. Older helium 8TB easystore idles around mid-30C and mid-40C under load. This new version reaches 59C under heavy use. Even though it reports itself as a 5400rpm drive, it might actually be 7200rpm, which explains the heat and loudness. 

Benchmarks via USB 3.0: 205 MB/s sequential read and 206 MB/s sequential write when empty. Great speeds for a hard drive, but worried about longevity due to excess heat."
WD,easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,WD - easystore 8TB External USB 3.0 Hard Drive - Black,"Aug 19, 2017 10:18 PM","I bought a few of these 8TB externals. It's common knowledge now that these externals have 8TB Western Digital Red drives inside of them. It's the reason why I went with Western Digital, and specifically not Seagate (with their shingle technology). They are very easy to ""shuck,"" allowing you to run them internally using SATA. However, the reason for the 4-star rating is that most consumers will not shuck them, and they do run hot inside of their casing. Temperatures exceed 45c at idle, and do reach 50c with use. Given they are WD Red drives, I'm confident they will survive those temperatures within the warranty period (2 years), but it's been tested and proven that hard drives do not do so well in terms of longevity with temperatures in excess of 40c. If you do shuck them, they run very cool; and you don't even have to install them internally. Just popping off the outer casing, and running a small fan on top keeps temperatures within 32-36c. I personally have 140mm fans blowing on top of mine still running on USB. My internal 8TB actually runs hotter due to less ventilation in my computer. Just keep in mind that if you shuck them and break the case, it will void the warranty. So outweigh the pros and cons before, and do your research on ""proper shucking"" :) Overall very satisfied with these 8TB Red NAS 256MB Cache drives."

Load times are pretty quick (depending on the game) and it makes almost no noise (not that I can tell since I wear a headset, although compared to my PS4 it might as well make no noise. I've got 65 games downloaded and still have a little more than 5 TB left. It's easy to use, just plug in the power supply then connect it to your PS4 via USB, format as extended storage and you're ready to go.

SanDisk,SDCZ60-128G-A46,SanDisk - Cruzer Glide 128GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive - Black,"Jul 30, 2015 3:18 PM","This is great to have as a ""just in case"" storage solution, but it can take a while to transfer files. Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you. But for an extra $10 why not upgrade and be future ready. I would chalk it up to buyer error due to misleading packaging, otherwise great value."

Even after reformatting they still wouldn't work. I went to best buy.com and for about $8.00 more, I got what I wanted. It worked perfectly as soon as I started using it.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you.

SanDisk,SDCZ60-128G-A46,SanDisk - Cruzer Glide 128GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive - Black,"Jul 30, 2015 3:18 PM","This is great to have as a ""just in case"" storage solution, but it can take a while to transfer files. Read and write speeds are ... well USB 2.0 slow. I bought this because in store I looked at the packaging and it led me to believe that it was USB 3.0. This was because it has USB 2.0/3.0 compatible on the front. I assumed it was USB 3.0 because I know they are backwards compatible and nowhere did it clearly state it was a USB 2.0 drive. Now that I am taking a picture of the front, I flipped it over and on the back really small it says USB 2.0 Drive. I am returning this one to get the USB 3.0 version, but for those who just need to keep documents and small files it is great. For me, I am a photographer and have hi-res files where I move GBs at a time which can take a while at USB 2.0 speeds. Nothing wrong with it, just doesn't work for my needs and it may work for you. But for an extra $10 why not upgrade and be future ready. I would chalk it up to buyer error due to misleading packaging, otherwise great value."

Crucial,CT1000X6SSD9SE,Crucial - X6 SE 1TB External USB-C/USB-A Portable SSD - Black,"Feb 3, 2024 1:04 PM","Crucial makes really great RAM and ""SSD"" drives.  I purchased the 1 TB X6 external, which has performed to my expectations so far.  I'm running a 2019 4k iMac with a Thunderbolt 3, to which the new drive is connected.
Super fast , command shift, split second and your project is saved!  Im working with Blender 3-D and need to save often, this drive is on the mark! 
   Since there is plenty of space I'm using the drive as a work and backup drive.  My second backup drive transferred 160GB via USB 2 in one hour, which is not bad for USB 2 to Thundrbolt3. Also transferred the same data to the internal drive from the X6, and did it in 15 minutes, that's surprisingly fast! Most impressive!"

This took a bit of trial and error to get set up, as the cord and adapter to connect to the console need to be oriented a particular way and this is not at all obvious.  Basically, there are two dots that need to be face up, see the photo where they show up as light spots on the cord near the top/center of the pic.    

It also is not the best for Series S / X optimized games as they cannot be played on it.   However, despite those limitations I do feel like this purchase made my Series S setup much, much better and am quite happy with the performance so far."

I purchased the 1 TB X6 external, which has performed to my expectations so far.  I'm running a 2019 4k iMac with a Thunderbolt 3, to which the new drive is connected.
Super fast , command shift, split second and your project is saved!  Im working with Blender 3-D and need to save often, this drive is on the mark! 
   Since there is plenty of space I'm using the drive as a work and backup drive.  My second backup drive transferred 160GB via USB 2 in one hour, which is not bad for USB 2 to Thundrbolt3. Also transferred the same data to the internal drive from the X6, and did it in 15 minutes, that's surprisingly fast! Most impressive!"

After looking into various options I landed on this one.  It is a travel SSD drive and so can fit in the palm of your hand.  It works with Series S for storage of Xbox-One / X360 / Xbox games.  This took a bit of trial and error to get set up, as the cord and adapter to connect to the console need to be oriented a particular way and this is not at all obvious.  Basically, there are two dots that need to be face up, see the photo where they show up as light spots on the cord near the top/center of the pic.    

It also is not the best for Series S / X optimized games as they cannot be played on it.   However, despite those limitations I do feel like this purchase made my Series S setup much, much better and am quite happy with the performance so far."

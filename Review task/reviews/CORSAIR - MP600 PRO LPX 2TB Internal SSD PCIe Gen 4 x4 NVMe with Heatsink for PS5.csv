CORSAIR,CSSD-F2000GBMP600PLP,CORSAIR - MP600 PRO LPX 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Mar 30, 2024 8:49 AM",Added this storage unit so I could download more of the games I have. I had ran out of space on my original 2.5 storage unit. And was quickly running out on an external hd that I had. The installation was a breeze. I only had one issue. The pc came with an empty nvme slot but the screw needed for installing the new nvme was not there. Thankfully I had a screw from a previous nvme in an old pc and was able to complete the installation. The performance is phenomenal. I highly recommend this for anyone needing an additional storage device. But ensure you have the screw to attach the unit or order one for it.

I thought delivery of this product would take forever, and Best Buy was able to get the product to me well ahead of schedule. Setting up this internal HD was a breeze. I only needed a single small tool from my tinker toolkit to remove 2 screws. 1 that held the door shut over the HD area, and one that is already in your PlayStation 5 to hold the HD itself in place. Your PS5 will ask that your choose to format the drive when you first turn on your PS5 after installation. Then you’re set. I was easily able to get 10 game titles on the internal HD, while only using about 15% of the total space available."

I had ran out of space on my original 2.5 storage unit. And was quickly running out on an external hd that I had. The installation was a breeze. I only had one issue.

Thankfully I had a screw from a previous nvme in an old pc and was able to complete the installation. The performance is phenomenal. I highly recommend this for anyone needing an additional storage device. But ensure you have the screw to attach the unit or order one for it.

I had ran out of space on my original 2.5 storage unit. And was quickly running out on an external hd that I had. The installation was a breeze. I only had one issue. The pc came with an empty nvme slot but the screw needed for installing the new nvme was not there. Thankfully I had a screw from a previous nvme in an old pc and was able to complete the installation. The performance is phenomenal. I highly recommend this for anyone needing an additional storage device. But ensure you have the screw to attach the unit or order one for it.

I only needed a single small tool from my tinker toolkit to remove 2 screws. 1 that held the door shut over the HD area, and one that is already in your PlayStation 5 to hold the HD itself in place. Your PS5 will ask that your choose to format the drive when you first turn on your PS5 after installation. Then you’re set.

I had ran out of space on my original 2.5 storage unit. And was quickly running out on an external hd that I had. The installation was a breeze. I only had one issue. The pc came with an empty nvme slot but the screw needed for installing the new nvme was not there. Thankfully I had a screw from a previous nvme in an old pc and was able to complete the installation. The performance is phenomenal. I highly recommend this for anyone needing an additional storage device. But ensure you have the screw to attach the unit or order one for it.

I thought delivery of this product would take forever, and Best Buy was able to get the product to me well ahead of schedule. Setting up this internal HD was a breeze. I only needed a single small tool from my tinker toolkit to remove 2 screws. 1 that held the door shut over the HD area, and one that is already in your PlayStation 5 to hold the HD itself in place. Your PS5 will ask that your choose to format the drive when you first turn on your PS5 after installation. Then you’re set. I was easily able to get 10 game titles on the internal HD, while only using about 15% of the total space available."

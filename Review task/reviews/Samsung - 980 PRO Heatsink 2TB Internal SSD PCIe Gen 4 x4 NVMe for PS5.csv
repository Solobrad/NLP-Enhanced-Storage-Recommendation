This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review. I definitely recommend them."

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating.

They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review.

(As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review. I definitely recommend them."

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review.

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review.

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating.

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating.

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating.

All's you need is a screwdriver once the slot is reached followed by a little trip to settings to transfer your games. Performance has been smooth and fast with my 2TB expansion. Giving me plenty of space at about a 2.6 TB total.

This 100% fixes the issues. There was a firmware bug when these launched that affected the 2tb 980 pros. (As well as 970 and 990) They would lock into read only mode and essentially self-deteriorate until no longer usuable. Some users claimed it took as little as 2 weeks and up to 6 months for this to happen. I have included pictures of the two manufacture dates of my purchased drives for my gaming pc. These both have shipped with the affected firmware. I knew this was a possibility before I purchased, but a quick update within Samsung Magician and everything has been fantastic. They have both been installed and at about half capacity a piece for about a month or so. There has been zero performance issues, both at 100% drive health, and operating well within acceptable temperature ranges under load. Even though they can be used in a PS5, I dont know if the bug is limited to just PC application. For that, I give a 4 star rating. Otherwise, if you have the means to update them, dont let the firmware issue sway you away. These have been fantastic so far for me. If anything changes, I will update my review. I definitely recommend them."

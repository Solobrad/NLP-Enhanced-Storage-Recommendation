+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

Samsung,T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,Samsung - T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,"Jul 1, 2022 4:02 PM","Having recently purchased a brand new MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 1TB SSD, I wanted a really good external SSD for Time Machine Backups.  I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.

+ small and portable

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

Samsung,T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,Samsung - T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,"Jul 1, 2022 4:02 PM","Having recently purchased a brand new MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 1TB SSD, I wanted a really good external SSD for Time Machine Backups.  I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

+ small and portable

+ easy setup

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.

It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable

+ easy setup

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

Samsung,T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,Samsung - T7 2TB External USB 3.2 Gen 2 Portable SSD with Hardware Encryption - Titan Gray,"Jul 1, 2022 4:02 PM","Having recently purchased a brand new MacBook Pro M1 Pro with 1TB SSD, I wanted a really good external SSD for Time Machine Backups.  I already own a much smaller Samsung SSD which has served me really well for the last few years.  So I knew in advance the Samsung T7 2TB would be the perfect choice for the task at hand.  It's simply amazing you can get portable SSD drives with so much real and usable storage, for the price of admission in this T7.

It came nicely packaged with every you need, including a little owners manual and a high quality USB C to USB C cable.  This drive is incredibly fast and was able to download hundreds of gigabytes of data quickly.  It's built to the best standards with durable thermal construction, which Samsung says defends against impact or overheating.  

Out of the box, it was recognized on my new MacBook and using Disc Utility, I formatted it appropriately for a Mac (using APFS) and while data is downloading, the little Blue LED blinks to let you know data is being accepted, then turns solid blue when the data transfer is complete.  You can password protect the drive and it includes 256-BIT AES hardware encryption, which scrambles data to make it nearly impossible to hack.

It's small, elegant, incredibly well made, protects your data and simply couldn't be easier to use.  If you've ever lost data before, you know how awful the feeling.  This T7 SSD from Samsung will ensure I can never lose data.  For the money, I simply can't recommend this enough."

+ small and portable 
+ fast 
+ easy setup 
+ user-friendly (plug and go)

Cons
- very smooth (which could be prone to sliding and falling if not on a flat/leveled surface)
- would be nice if it had a feature or warning that this device is overheating (haven't had this issue yet, but it would be nice to know if it starts to overheat)

If any company out there could make a simple silicone case/wrap to give it some grip and added protection on the corners and edges, to avoid sliding or slipping out your fingers, that would be a great compliment to this device.  
 
Overall the product is solid and works great with no issues yet. Quality for the price, will be buying more in the future."

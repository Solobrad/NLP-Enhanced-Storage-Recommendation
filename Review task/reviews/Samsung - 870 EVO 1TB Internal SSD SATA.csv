One of the biggest challenges with laptop upgrades is the complexity involved, but this SSD made it a breeze, thanks to its compatibility with a SATA USB cable.

Ease of Installation:
The installation process was surprisingly easy. The SSD was ready to use with just a simple connection using a SATA USB cable. This plug-and-play setup is a game-changer for anyone not well-versed in computer hardware. It took no time to get the drive up and running, and the process was straightforward even for an advanced user like me and easily done for novices.
i.e.

Right-click on the Start menu and select 'Disk Management'.

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

There's often a concern that expanding storage might compromise performance, but this drive dispelled all those doubts. My laptop now boots up faster, and applications load in the blink of an eye. The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

The first thing I wanted to do was replace the old 1 TB SATA HD with a new SSD. I purchased this Samsung 870 EVO and couldn't be happier with it's performance. Installation was a breeze. I purchased the Sabrent SATA Hard Drive/SSD to USB 3.0 Adapter from Best Buy to clone the current drive. The 870 EVO came with Magician Software and the Sabrent adapter came with Acronis Cloning Software. I used The Magician and it worked perfectly.

Having past experiences with SSDs, I knew the speed difference would be more than noticeable. The wife, however, was pleasantly shocked that the old computer was made somewhat ""new-ish"" again. It was very easy to switch out in a Lenovo (old hdd in photo) and copy over (get the affordable SSD to USB kit to copy the data from the old HDD first, then install SSD). We can put off buying a new laptop for at least another year or so. Thanks Samsung for another quality product!"

She said ( I don't know if I'm allowed to name names here, but she was really well informed and knew her stuff) it would give me the boost in performance for my operating system & programs loading times I was looking for. My PC was taking 2 min.’s 30 sec.’s just to boot-up to the desk top!! I had the Greek Squad install the new drive and move my operating system & all files over to the new Samsung SSD. They did a GREAT job!
I got the P.C. back in 3 day’s, NICE! My P.C. now boot’s up in 27sec’s to the desk top! WOW! What a performance boost! The Samsung - 870 EVO 1TB was also a reasonable price.

Samsung,870 EVO 1TB Internal SSD SATA,Samsung - 870 EVO 1TB Internal SSD SATA,"Apr 13, 2024 2:41 PM","Back in 2022, I wanted to upgrade to upgrade my hard drive that came from my PC installed (which is HDD) because it was getting slow few years later since I bought it. So I bought this Samsung hard drive and followed the instructions. 

After installing, I'm impressed with the speeds especially the startup, which is close as advertised (see picture below) and as of typing this review, it's still going strong! Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

After a little over a month into ownership, it has been working out pretty well. Files are written to the Samsung 870 EVO SATA 2.5"" SSD 1TB very quickly when Lightroom is utilized, so it serves its purpose quite nicely.

I'm hoping that the Samsung 870 EVO SATA 2.5"" SSD 1TB will be in service inside my computer for many years ahead."

I have a 13 year old HP ENVY Notebook that was very sluggish. I upgraded my RAM from 8GB to 16GB first, but the 500GB HDD still bogged down overall performance. I then upgraded my 500GB HDD to the Samsung 870 EVO SSD 1 TB. The Samsung ""magic"" software transferred all of my content over from the original HDD easily. However, I had trouble getting my laptop OS to boot with the new SSD. I downloaded new Microsoft OS onto a blank thumb drive and tried to boot up with it. After changing the boot order in BIOS multiple times, I still wasn't able to boot from the thumb drive or the SSD. 

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

One of the biggest challenges with laptop upgrades is the complexity involved, but this SSD made it a breeze, thanks to its compatibility with a SATA USB cable.

Ease of Installation:
The installation process was surprisingly easy. The SSD was ready to use with just a simple connection using a SATA USB cable. This plug-and-play setup is a game-changer for anyone not well-versed in computer hardware. It took no time to get the drive up and running, and the process was straightforward even for an advanced user like me and easily done for novices.
i.e.
Connect the SSD with a SATA to USB cable and connect this to your computer.

Right-click on the Start menu and select 'Disk Management'.

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

Performance:
What impressed me the most was how the Samsung 870 EVO maintained the lightning-fast speed expected from an SSD. There's often a concern that expanding storage might compromise performance, but this drive dispelled all those doubts. My laptop now boots up faster, and applications load in the blink of an eye. The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

After installing, I'm impressed with the speeds especially the startup, which is close as advertised (see picture below) and as of typing this review, it's still going strong! Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

One of the biggest challenges with laptop upgrades is the complexity involved, but this SSD made it a breeze, thanks to its compatibility with a SATA USB cable.

Ease of Installation:
The installation process was surprisingly easy. The SSD was ready to use with just a simple connection using a SATA USB cable. This plug-and-play setup is a game-changer for anyone not well-versed in computer hardware. It took no time to get the drive up and running, and the process was straightforward even for an advanced user like me and easily done for novices.
i.e.
Connect the SSD with a SATA to USB cable and connect this to your computer.

Right-click on the Start menu and select 'Disk Management'.

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

Performance:
What impressed me the most was how the Samsung 870 EVO maintained the lightning-fast speed expected from an SSD. There's often a concern that expanding storage might compromise performance, but this drive dispelled all those doubts. My laptop now boots up faster, and applications load in the blink of an eye. The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

After installing, I'm impressed with the speeds especially the startup, which is close as advertised (see picture below) and as of typing this review, it's still going strong! Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

One of the biggest challenges with laptop upgrades is the complexity involved, but this SSD made it a breeze, thanks to its compatibility with a SATA USB cable.

Ease of Installation:
The installation process was surprisingly easy. The SSD was ready to use with just a simple connection using a SATA USB cable. This plug-and-play setup is a game-changer for anyone not well-versed in computer hardware. It took no time to get the drive up and running, and the process was straightforward even for an advanced user like me and easily done for novices.
i.e.
Connect the SSD with a SATA to USB cable and connect this to your computer.

Right-click on the Start menu and select 'Disk Management'.

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

Performance:
What impressed me the most was how the Samsung 870 EVO maintained the lightning-fast speed expected from an SSD. There's often a concern that expanding storage might compromise performance, but this drive dispelled all those doubts. My laptop now boots up faster, and applications load in the blink of an eye. The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

After installing, I'm impressed with the speeds especially the startup, which is close as advertised (see picture below) and as of typing this review, it's still going strong! Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

One of the biggest challenges with laptop upgrades is the complexity involved, but this SSD made it a breeze, thanks to its compatibility with a SATA USB cable.

Ease of Installation:
The installation process was surprisingly easy. The SSD was ready to use with just a simple connection using a SATA USB cable. This plug-and-play setup is a game-changer for anyone not well-versed in computer hardware. It took no time to get the drive up and running, and the process was straightforward even for an advanced user like me and easily done for novices.
i.e.
Connect the SSD with a SATA to USB cable and connect this to your computer.

Right-click on the Start menu and select 'Disk Management'.

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

Performance:
What impressed me the most was how the Samsung 870 EVO maintained the lightning-fast speed expected from an SSD. There's often a concern that expanding storage might compromise performance, but this drive dispelled all those doubts. My laptop now boots up faster, and applications load in the blink of an eye. The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

After installing, I'm impressed with the speeds especially the startup, which is close as advertised (see picture below) and as of typing this review, it's still going strong! Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

Therefore, I highly recommended this if you're looking to upgrade."

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

In Disk Management, find the SSD (shown as 'Unallocated'), right-click it, and select 'Initialize Disk'. Select GPT (GUID Partition Table) as the partition style.

Right-click on the unallocated space on the SSD, select 'New Simple Volume', and follow the wizard. Assign a drive letter and format to NTFS.

Lastly, Right-click the new volume, select 'Format', choose 'NTFS', and leave the allocation unit size as default.

Your new SSD is ready to use and just like that you expanded your laptop's storage space in minutes and without compromising the speed of using an SSD!

The 1TB capacity is a massive upgrade, especially for laptops where storage is usually limited.

Expanding a laptop's storage is often seen as a daunting task, but this Samsung SSD makes it accessible, easy, and Its cost-effective way to breathe new life into an older laptop or enhance the capacity of a new one. The boost in storage space is a significant advantage for anyone dealing with large files or requiring more space for applications and games.

Opening Chrome takes an instant and it loads games faster as well, but do not expect to load lightning fast when it comes to gaming. Now I don't have to wait for a while!

For those who are planning to buy this drive, you need an adapter (USB to SATA) to transfer data from your old drive to this new SSD drive (will take you a few hours depending how much is stored).

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

After a little over a month into ownership, it has been working out pretty well. Files are written to the Samsung 870 EVO SATA 2.5"" SSD 1TB very quickly when Lightroom is utilized, so it serves its purpose quite nicely.

I'm hoping that the Samsung 870 EVO SATA 2.5"" SSD 1TB will be in service inside my computer for many years ahead."

I have a 13 year old HP ENVY Notebook that was very sluggish. I upgraded my RAM from 8GB to 16GB first, but the 500GB HDD still bogged down overall performance. I then upgraded my 500GB HDD to the Samsung 870 EVO SSD 1 TB. The Samsung ""magic"" software transferred all of my content over from the original HDD easily. However, I had trouble getting my laptop OS to boot with the new SSD. I downloaded new Microsoft OS onto a blank thumb drive and tried to boot up with it. After changing the boot order in BIOS multiple times, I still wasn't able to boot from the thumb drive or the SSD. 

I read several reviews and posts on how to put the OS on a new SSD. I called HP for assistance but they just tried to sell me something. I called Samsung 870 EVO customer support, and while the tech tried to help, he ended up telling me that I might not have the necessary drivers needed.

In the end, I don't really know how it worked, but after several boot attempts, and I mean several, the OS was finally able to boot from the new SSD."

I used to have 100% disk usage recurrently, and now it remains below 20%. I bought it two years ago and it still performs great (see picture below)

Normally I play League of Legends or Minecraft, which aren't very demanding games as it comes to data retrieval, but if you're thinking about switching to solid state definitely go for it."

The improvement I got in speed was far greater than I expected. Everything improved from boot time to programs loading and running smoother. This relatively small priced purchase gives this computer many more years of very productive use.

Since its an SSD, I just let it rest somewhere because it doesn't have any moving parts.

Samsung also has software for diagnostics of their drives. I've had this one for just under a year (review is start of September, bought the drive the previous end of October), and it's seeing no issues after 4TB of data having been written to it."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"Dec 18, 2023 2:16 PM","I usually never use or recommend Hdd's anymore but since I tend to do a lot of gaming and music recording, I wanted a drive to hold photos, videos and music files without using my ssds.  This is a great for fairly static storage and a lot faster than my old 1tb that wasn't 7200rpm."
Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"Feb 9, 2024 3:58 PM",This hard drive was A at affordable price and a good amount of storage haven’t had any problems at all in the store where I picked it up was very nice
Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

While i have bought PC's that had other drives, when it came to upgrade the HDD, it was always a BarraCuda. I have a 750GB as a back-up drive and it's been in use for 10 years; soon it will probably get upgraded to a 2TB.Install was super easy and there are plenty of YouTube guides if you don't know what you're doing. It doesn't come with a SATA Cable or the power connector, but your PC may have extra power connectors. The SATA Cable I had to purchase separate, but it was very cheap."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"Feb 9, 2024 3:58 PM",This hard drive was A at affordable price and a good amount of storage haven’t had any problems at all in the store where I picked it up was very nice
Seagate ,ST2000DMA08,Seagate - Barracuda 2TB Internal SATA Hard Drive for Desktops,"May 1, 2020 10:12 PM","This drive is not only quieter than Western Digital drives (as usual), but it is very fast for a HDD. This 2 TB drive is composed of just a single platter inside with 1 TB on each face. This means there's less physical area that the data is spread-out over, so seek times will be quicker than drives with multiple platters. I upgraded an older Seagate BarraCuda C: drive from years ago. Booting up Windows 10 on a Dell XPS takes just a fraction of the time it used to. 

The 256 MB buffer size is great for Windows/system drives that retrieve OS information regularly, making certain applications load much more quickly. With a decent desktop computer, this drive isn't all that much slower than an SSD... not to mention hard drives inherently hold data for much longer (in my experience, lightly used hard drives last far longer than flash storage, which degrades in a few years).

Whether you're building a new rig or just upgrading old components, I highly recommend this drive.

NOTE: 

1. This drive's model number is ST2000DM008, not ...DMA08, if you want to look up the datasheet online.

2. Be sure the drive is formatted as a GPT disk (not MBR) if you plan on using this as your new C: drive (or boot drive)."

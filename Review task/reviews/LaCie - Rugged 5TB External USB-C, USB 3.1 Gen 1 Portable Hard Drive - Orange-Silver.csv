LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Jun 13, 2023 12:25 PM",Ive been wanting this drive for the longest! And the wait was worth it!!!!
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."

Highly portable and fast enough to edit on the fly. Works flawlessly with iPad Pro as well as PC. An excellent fast and reliable file bucket. Might get a second for backup given how cheap it is. Software is actually useful for that purpose. Syncs with Adobe easily. Just point Lightroom to it and it’s a seamless experience.

I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Finally, I had a world of trouble with the MacOS randomly disconnecting the drives until I reformatted them as MacOS Journaled. Since then, I've had no issues at all."

LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."

I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage.

LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."

I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage.

LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."

I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage.

LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."

I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage.

LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Aug 12, 2022 10:16 PM","I've owned this drive for several months now and I'm not very happy with the performance. Although this is a USB-C/USB 3.1 drive, it's extremely slow due to the spinning hard drive. I knew what I was buying when I decided to purchase this model, but I did not expect the transfer speeds to be THIS slow. I get about 50-60 MB/s transfer speed benchmarked using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. Drive is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 port on an iMac capable of a theoretical 40 Gb/s. This drive might as well be connected to a USB 2.0 port and you still wouldn't max out USB 2.0 transfer speeds. Bottom line, the bottleneck is the spinning hard drive, not the interface, and from the looks of it, this is one heck of a slow spinning drive. I thought I might be able to use this to expand my video editing library on iMovie, but I was very wrong. Unusable for anything other than storage. You can't run anything live from this drive and expect any kind of usable performance."
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Nov 22, 2022 7:05 PM",Love it! This works great for storing video content. 5TB is actually more than you think.
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Nov 12, 2022 10:42 AM","Reliable & Rugged. I've had the 2tb version for 5+ years, and when I needed mobile large storage for offloading RAW video files, I knew this was the best option for me."
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Jul 22, 2022 4:41 PM","I use this to hold photos from my SLR. Highly portable and fast enough to edit on the fly. Works flawlessly with iPad Pro as well as PC. An excellent fast and reliable file bucket. Might get a second for backup given how cheap it is. Software is actually useful for that purpose. Syncs with Adobe easily. Just point Lightroom to it and it’s a seamless experience. Pros might want something more like a NAS with RAID, but as an enthusiast this fits the bill."
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Nov 22, 2022 1:26 PM",Works just as described! Excellent product. Will definitely be recommending this to others!
LaCie,STFR5000800,"LaCie - Rugged 5TB External USB-C, USB 3.1 Gen 1 Portable Hard Drive - Orange/Silver","Dec 30, 2023 1:18 PM","I've owned this model drive for years and just bought three in 5TB sizes for my photography work. I've found them reliable and certainly durable. However, they are a bit slow so I would not recommend them for video. However, for photos these drives are just fine and I've never had one break on me before. 

The read/write speeds on these drives is roughly 120/110MB/s. For comparison's sake, the read/write speed for my MacBook's internal drive is 6,000+/4,000+, a huge difference. 

FWIW, I'm running a 2023 MacBook Pro with the M3Pro chip, 18GB of ram and Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Finally, I had a world of trouble with the MacOS randomly disconnecting the drives until I reformatted them as MacOS Journaled. Since then, I've had no issues at all."

Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jul 2, 2023 6:36 AM","Install into PS5 was easy. SSD is super fast. Great mod for storage, performance and future proofing. Great price considering they just dropped the 540."
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Sep 15, 2023 3:52 PM",This has only been in my PlayStation for a few weeks but so far it is great! Super simple to install and gives me so much more storage on my PS5. The hard drive was smaller and heavier than expected but it seems solid. Downloading to it is extremely fast too.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jun 23, 2023 9:23 PM",Great product. Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Apr 28, 2023 8:10 PM","Item came on time and in great condition. Haven’t experienced any problems so far! It was working properly after setting up with formatting. Runs faster than the ps5. Delivers amazing performance and graphics with games stored on it. I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Make sure to get it with the heat sink. I’ve had no issues since install, and have seen a performance gain in downloads and transfers. I’d highly recommend you buy this right now and stop doing your research. This is it!"

 This also loads very fast and quick game to game. I love it so much.
 This hard drive is also very easy to install into your PS5 console without any issues.
 I would totally recommend this to all my friends for their PS5."

It promises read speeds of 7,300 MB/s. When PS5 was powered on, it only read 5,500 MB/s. I understand PS5 May not be able to handle the full 7,300 MB/s, however I saw other reviews installed on the PS5; as they were receiving read speeds of around 6,500 MB/s. Not sure what may have caused this, as I followed exact instructions online."

It was very easy to install, and only took a few minutes to get it booted up and installed onto the system. Definitely reccommended if you're looking at other options such as the 980 Pro or the WD Black. This one is worth the price alone and has very fast speeds that will last you for life."

I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Apr 28, 2023 8:10 PM","Item came on time and in great condition. Haven’t experienced any problems so far! It was working properly after setting up with formatting. Runs faster than the ps5. Delivers amazing performance and graphics with games stored on it. I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

I understand PS5 May not be able to handle the full 7,300 MB/s, however I saw other reviews installed on the PS5; as they were receiving read speeds of around 6,500 MB/s.

Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities.

Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities.

Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities.

Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities.

Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jun 23, 2023 9:23 PM",Great product. Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Super simple to install and gives me so much more storage on my PS5. The hard drive was smaller and heavier than expected but it seems solid. Downloading to it is extremely fast too.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jun 23, 2023 9:23 PM",Great product. Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

Haven’t experienced any problems so far! It was working properly after setting up with formatting. Runs faster than the ps5. Delivers amazing performance and graphics with games stored on it. I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Sep 15, 2023 3:52 PM",This has only been in my PlayStation for a few weeks but so far it is great! Super simple to install and gives me so much more storage on my PS5. The hard drive was smaller and heavier than expected but it seems solid. Downloading to it is extremely fast too.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jun 23, 2023 9:23 PM",Great product. Considering that Best Buy has this item on sale the quality of this SSD is amazing. Read speed was at 6267 Megabytes per second after installation. considering that the recommended speed for extension SSD for PS5 is 5500 MB/s it gets what needed. It’s truly a Firecuda there. I highly recommend this product if you trying to find a quality extension SSD for your PS5. It has high number of read/write cycles which basically will serve your needs for as long as you’re planning to have your PS5. It fits perfectly into the slot and no additional heat sink is needed. Installation process is very simple you can do it yourself using a video from YouTube. I always use BestBuy to purchase quality products. Best in BestBuy means best goods.

Haven’t experienced any problems so far! It was working properly after setting up with formatting. Runs faster than the ps5. Delivers amazing performance and graphics with games stored on it. I’m glad I upgraded my system to this. I’m able to load all my ps5/ps4 games on there quickly. Perfect for real gamers! I’m confirming that it’s completely compatible. The loading times are the same nothing slows down. You can download, update, and save games on this. If you can afford it definitely a great option if available. Only downside is that the ps5 has less storage than the Xbox so I had to purchase this. I heard a lot of bad things about cheaper SSD drives and I didn’t want to ruin my ps5 capabilities. Therefore I was happy to pay for the best price to find one in-order to upgrade my system. Great quality. I would definitely recommend."

Make sure to get it with the heat sink. I’ve had no issues since install, and have seen a performance gain in downloads and transfers. I’d highly recommend you buy this right now and stop doing your research. This is it!"

 This hard drive is also very easy to install into your PS5 console without any issues.
 I would totally recommend this to all my friends for their PS5."
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jun 29, 2023 9:19 PM","Install was super easy, as I followed directions from a video; however was a bit bummed out when I saw the read speeds on PS5. It promises read speeds of 7,300 MB/s. When PS5 was powered on, it only read 5,500 MB/s. I understand PS5 May not be able to handle the full 7,300 MB/s, however I saw other reviews installed on the PS5; as they were receiving read speeds of around 6,500 MB/s. Not sure what may have caused this, as I followed exact instructions online."

I had this on my ps5 for almost a year now and the ability to download any game in minutes is amazing. Having kids they get impatient and this also helps keep them calm when a 2 hour download comes down in just 8 minutes.
Seagate,ZP2000GM3A023,Seagate - FireCuda 530 2TB Internal SSD PCIe Gen 4 x4 NVMe with Heatsink for PS5,"Jan 26, 2022 2:00 PM","I was looking for an NVMe SSD for my PS5 as it was running out of internal space for the SSD for the system. It was very easy to install, and only took a few minutes to get it booted up and installed onto the system. Definitely reccommended if you're looking at other options such as the 980 Pro or the WD Black. This one is worth the price alone and has very fast speeds that will last you for life."

I do have a problem with Best Buy and their price match. After a week the price went down about $60 and my credit card was supposed to be debited but never was so I guess I’ll keep the laptop they left on my doorstep I didn’t order to make up the difference and then some.  Also never got a confirmation email.  The customer service rep was very polite so I felt like I was being taken care of but didn’t happen."

Wipe the drive, return to Best Buy, find a solution that works.

1)   It will not work without an internet connection, because everything MUST pass through the Western Digital server.   Western Digital Server down or busy or internet down...  your files are unavailable.   Your ""My Cloud Home"" is just a white brick on your desk.

2)   It sounds like a rock crusher that NEVER stops crushing rocks.   It is constantly crushing rocks anytime the power is connected, not just while you're writing files to it.   What is it doing with the disk 24 hours 7 days a week?

3)   Third issue... it is a VERY SLOW process.   My fiber optic internet is reliable and runs around 900mbs.   I tried to copy 1.5TB of files to the ""My Cloud Home""... five hours later I gave up with only a few percent copied.   It still claimed it would take more than one day to finish writing the files.   I guess this is caused by the complexity of the process involving internet and Western Digital Servers.   I spent days copying many smaller batches of files.

4)   One last issue... it's often unavailable.   It disappears from Windows File Explorer.   You have to mess with the WD software or sometimes reboot the PC."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."

The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."

This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

Wipe the drive, return to Best Buy, find a solution that works.

1)   It will not work without an internet connection, because everything MUST pass through the Western Digital server.   Western Digital Server down or busy or internet down...  your files are unavailable.   Your ""My Cloud Home"" is just a white brick on your desk.

2)   It sounds like a rock crusher that NEVER stops crushing rocks.   It is constantly crushing rocks anytime the power is connected, not just while you're writing files to it.   What is it doing with the disk 24 hours 7 days a week?

3)   Third issue... it is a VERY SLOW process.   My fiber optic internet is reliable and runs around 900mbs.   I tried to copy 1.5TB of files to the ""My Cloud Home""... five hours later I gave up with only a few percent copied.   It still claimed it would take more than one day to finish writing the files.   I guess this is caused by the complexity of the process involving internet and Western Digital Servers.   I spent days copying many smaller batches of files.

4)   One last issue... it's often unavailable.   It disappears from Windows File Explorer.   You have to mess with the WD software or sometimes reboot the PC."

2)   It sounds like a rock crusher that NEVER stops crushing rocks.   It is constantly crushing rocks anytime the power is connected, not just while you're writing files to it.   What is it doing with the disk 24 hours 7 days a week?

3)   Third issue... it is a VERY SLOW process.   My fiber optic internet is reliable and runs around 900mbs.   I tried to copy 1.5TB of files to the ""My Cloud Home""... five hours later I gave up with only a few percent copied.   It still claimed it would take more than one day to finish writing the files.   I guess this is caused by the complexity of the process involving internet and Western Digital Servers.   I spent days copying many smaller batches of files.

4)   One last issue... it's often unavailable.   It disappears from Windows File Explorer.   You have to mess with the WD software or sometimes reboot the PC."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected.

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

Provides access to files anywhere
Backs up certain cloud storage and mobile devices

Desktop program offers several applications without telling you they require a purchase
Legacy desktop program mostly just redirects to website
No matching modern desktop application
Drive letter on desktop fixed at Y
No main account for viewing and controlling all files on drive
No option to encrypt all files on drive
No pin access control option like on mobile
Very limited compared to a traditional NAS
Software is overly basic and different between desktop and mobile

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

However, ""on March 26, 2023, Western Digital identified a network security incident involving Western Digital’s systems.

Wipe the drive, return to Best Buy, find a solution that works.

1)   It will not work without an internet connection, because everything MUST pass through the Western Digital server.   Western Digital Server down or busy or internet down...  your files are unavailable.   Your ""My Cloud Home"" is just a white brick on your desk.

2)   It sounds like a rock crusher that NEVER stops crushing rocks.   It is constantly crushing rocks anytime the power is connected, not just while you're writing files to it.   What is it doing with the disk 24 hours 7 days a week?

3)   Third issue... it is a VERY SLOW process.   My fiber optic internet is reliable and runs around 900mbs.   I tried to copy 1.5TB of files to the ""My Cloud Home""... five hours later I gave up with only a few percent copied.   It still claimed it would take more than one day to finish writing the files.   I guess this is caused by the complexity of the process involving internet and Western Digital Servers.   I spent days copying many smaller batches of files.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."

This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology.

If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck!

In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option.

This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

Wipe the drive, return to Best Buy, find a solution that works.

1)   It will not work without an internet connection, because everything MUST pass through the Western Digital server.   Western Digital Server down or busy or internet down...  your files are unavailable.   Your ""My Cloud Home"" is just a white brick on your desk.

2)   It sounds like a rock crusher that NEVER stops crushing rocks.   It is constantly crushing rocks anytime the power is connected, not just while you're writing files to it.   What is it doing with the disk 24 hours 7 days a week?

3)   Third issue... it is a VERY SLOW process.   My fiber optic internet is reliable and runs around 900mbs.   I tried to copy 1.5TB of files to the ""My Cloud Home""... five hours later I gave up with only a few percent copied.   It still claimed it would take more than one day to finish writing the files.   I guess this is caused by the complexity of the process involving internet and Western Digital Servers.   I spent days copying many smaller batches of files.

4)   One last issue... it's often unavailable.   It disappears from Windows File Explorer.   You have to mess with the WD software or sometimes reboot the PC."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

However, ""on March 26, 2023, Western Digital identified a network security incident involving Western Digital’s systems. In connection with the ongoing incident, an unauthorized third party gained access to a number of the Company’s systems.""

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."

If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion.

If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN).

No option to encrypt all files on drive
No pin access control option like on mobile
Very limited compared to a traditional NAS
Software is overly basic and different between desktop and mobile

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want.

The Western Digital My Cloud Home is the latest iteration of a series of network-attached drives. With the addition of the name Home in the latest version of the product, there is no doubt should be left what audience Western Digital is targeting. Tech products for home typically have a greater emphasis on appearance. Although style is subjective, most would likely agree the My Cloud Home has a subtle and attractive design that most people would not object to placing out in the open. It has ventilation slots on the top and bottom to allow passive cooing, meaning no annoying sound of fans running. For the size, it feels quite heavy. Judging from what is visible in the cooling slots, it appears to be due to large heatsinks. Hopefully, this should translate to a long service life.

My Cloud Home seems to be more smartphone oriented which makes the initial setup easy but rather odd. The reason is that the unit comes with a setup card that includes an activation code. The sheet instructs you to set up the drive on a computer. It works just fine using the website on a phone but the process could use some refinement. If you have a previous generation My Cloud, you cannot use the old app. It is strange and confusing that the new unit, which shares many of the same features as the previous generation, requires a new and only slightly differently named app. There are a few extra functions which can be added including Plex, an import tool from a legacy My Cloud, and a backup tool for different cloud storage options.

You can configure the mobile app to backup your camera roll but not files stored on your mobile device. Cloud backup is a handy option to put final control of your OneDrive or Google Drive documents back in your hands. With each account, you can configure one of each type of cloud storage to download and backup onto your My Cloud Home. Once configured, your files will be downloaded for backup locally so if for whatever reason you lose access to your cloud storage you will still have your files. Unfortunately, there is no status of your sync provided except an email upon completion. Files are accessible via the app on mobile with photos and videos having a dedicate section that works fast but offers little organization. If you have many photos and videos, be prepared for a lot of scrolling. For traditional computers there is a program available although it is essentially a link to the My Cloud website and a list of programs you can install. What is not apparent is that most of the applications require a purchase of a product or subscription until you install them. Unfortunately, there is no corresponding modern Windows App in the store that is battery aware and touch friendly.

The software strives to keep things simple and to that end much the complication of standard file and folder sharing is not present. If you want to have the options to share the way it is done at work, this is not the one you will want. The way the system works is once the owner registers via email, others can be invited via email to use the My Cloud Home. Each account is separate from the others giving each person their own private space. Each user has a way to share files based on email accounts but options are much more limited.

If you have read this far, you will notice that each feature comes with what could be considered a negative. The My Cloud Home attempts to be simple but the problem is each feature seams either unfinished or overly basic. Overall, it is a solid unit with good performance. In testing, it backed up 125GB from a OneDrive account in less than a day. Stability was good with no occurrences of lockups or freezes. Remote access worked without any special knowledge required greater than entering in an activation code. If you are looking for a network storage for home with advanced features, it might be best to wait and see how Western Digital updates the software or use another option. If your main need is for a hands off device to backup your important files, the My Cloud Home will happily work in the background without needing any further work."
WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Sep 24, 2017 5:52 PM","I recently installed a Western Digital My Cloud Home 4 TB for testing purposes. This is a single drive, home backup system for PCs and mobile devices. It is a very easy solution to setup for most home users that have simple backup requirements.

Your data is actually stored in multiple locations: your device/pc, the WD MyCoud Home device, and in the WD MyCloud online storage solution. If you don’t already use solutions to backup your phone photos/videos, this device is drop-dead simple to setup and a must have to keep your memories safe!

Seriously – just plug it into your home network, create your free WD account, install the app on your mobile device(s) or PC(s) and start backing your stuff up! I can’t tell you how many people have asked me to recover photos or lost them because they’ve lost their phone! Unless they’ve got a recent backup, they are out of luck! Just setup the “Auto Backup” to automatically backup your photos to our MyCloud Home device so they are protected. If you don’t have unlimited cellular data – no worries, you can configure it to only use Wifi for the auto backups!

Another cool feature is the ability to backup your other cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Facebook photos, etc. Now you have them all in one place (well two including the cloud) nad are safe and secure!

There are lots of features that I haven’t setup up yet – like PC backup,Desktop Sync, Plex (music, videos, etc) and IFTTT.
I would definitely recommend the dual hard drive option (the Duo) versus a single drive option – after all the purpose of the device is to make sure you don’t lose data."

WD,WDBVXC0040HWT-NESN,WD - My Cloud Home 4TB Personal Cloud - White,"Jan 2, 2018 11:58 PM","After recently noticing my TimeMachine Backups were not completing on my Seagate GoFlex Home drive (bought long ago from BestBuy), I searched BestBuy's web site looking for another solution. I found the WD MyCloud drive was at my nearby BestBuy and headed over there. When I arrived I also saw they had the WD MyCloud Home drive (in more size options on the shelf than the MyCloud drive). The larger size drive immediately available appealed to me. When I asked the BestBuy ""expert"" about the differences, I was told the only difference was ""marketing/packaging."" This is NOT the case. 

The short story: the WD MyCloud Home product was designed and intended as a very different product/solution from the WD MyClould product.

The long story: of course, initially I was disappointed in finding out I had not purchased what I reviewed earlier. However, I then spent some signficant time reading and learning as much as I could about both of these products. In the best light, the WD MyCloud Home is a very new direction from the true NAS type WD MyCloud product. It is intended to be a ""simpler"" product to setup, and never was intended to provide (at least out of the box) the functionailty of the MyCloud product. In that regard, I believe it achieves its intended goal. And I think the WD MyCloud team would admittingly view this current version of the product to be more of a ""minimum marketable featured/minimum viable prodcut"" (MMF/MVP) type release. They are looking at a new direction to go after a potentially bigger market of users who need to be backing up, but have no understanding or immediate need for a more feature rich NAS drive. That is, everything I've read indicates the new MyHome Cloud product is intended to have its functionality/features extended via add-on applications. From a lean product development perspective I understand this approach. If you don't need a ""full-featured NAS"" drive immediately, and the MyCloud Home drive meets your immediate simple needs (ex. backup drive, simple cloud-like folder-based file download-only sharing), you might be rewarded down the road as more applications are developed for what appears to be a potentially more extendable technology than the currently more complex, more fully NAS featured, but what also appears to be not as adaptable MyCloud technology. 

For the record, I kept the MyCloud Home drive. It was very easy to setup, works great with all the MacOS based laptops on my home network. The simple folder-based download only file sharing meets my simple needs, as I'm able to use MacOS network sharing for R/W type file sharing locally (LAN). That said, I'd love to see additional MyCloud Home apps (soon) beyond the small number that currently exists today (which I don't find worth much)."

Hooking it up is a breeze. It comes with a USB-C thingy and it worked straight away with my laptop and even my phone. Didn’t need to mess around with any settings or software, which is a huge plus for me.

About the price, yeah, it’s not cheap, but you're getting a lot of storage and the speed is worth it, in my opinion.

First off, it's really small and sleek, which I love. It's black, looks cool, and feels sturdy enough that I'm not worried about it getting banged up in my bag.

The best part? This thing is fast. Like, really fast. I've been moving huge files around and it doesn’t even blink. It's got a ton of space too – 4TB is more than enough for all my stuff. I've got loads of photos and videos and there's still plenty of room left.

Hooking it up is a breeze. It comes with a USB-C thingy and it worked straight away with my laptop and even my phone. Didn’t need to mess around with any settings or software, which is a huge plus for me.

About the price, yeah, it’s not cheap, but you're getting a lot of storage and the speed is worth it, in my opinion.

First off, it's really small and sleek, which I love. It's black, looks cool, and feels sturdy enough that I'm not worried about it getting banged up in my bag.

The best part? This thing is fast. Like, really fast. I've been moving huge files around and it doesn’t even blink. It's got a ton of space too – 4TB is more than enough for all my stuff. I've got loads of photos and videos and there's still plenty of room left.

Hooking it up is a breeze. It comes with a USB-C thingy and it worked straight away with my laptop and even my phone. Didn’t need to mess around with any settings or software, which is a huge plus for me.

About the price, yeah, it’s not cheap, but you're getting a lot of storage and the speed is worth it, in my opinion.

First off, it's really small and sleek, which I love. It's black, looks cool, and feels sturdy enough that I'm not worried about it getting banged up in my bag.

The best part? This thing is fast. Like, really fast. I've been moving huge files around and it doesn’t even blink. It's got a ton of space too – 4TB is more than enough for all my stuff. I've got loads of photos and videos and there's still plenty of room left.

Hooking it up is a breeze. It comes with a USB-C thingy and it worked straight away with my laptop and even my phone. Didn’t need to mess around with any settings or software, which is a huge plus for me.

About the price, yeah, it’s not cheap, but you're getting a lot of storage and the speed is worth it, in my opinion.

SanDisk,SDSSDE61-4T00-G25B,SanDisk - Extreme Portable 4TB External USB-C NVMe SSD - Sky Blue,"Jan 5, 2024 7:50 PM","Okay, so I got this SanDisk 4TB portable SSD and it's pretty awesome. First off, it's really small and sleek, which I love. It's black, looks cool, and feels sturdy enough that I'm not worried about it getting banged up in my bag.

The best part? This thing is fast. Like, really fast. I've been moving huge files around and it doesn’t even blink. It's got a ton of space too – 4TB is more than enough for all my stuff. I've got loads of photos and videos and there's still plenty of room left.

Hooking it up is a breeze. It comes with a USB-C thingy and it worked straight away with my laptop and even my phone. Didn’t need to mess around with any settings or software, which is a huge plus for me.

About the price, yeah, it’s not cheap, but you're getting a lot of storage and the speed is worth it, in my opinion.

In short, if you need a lot of storage on the go and hate waiting for files to transfer, this SanDisk SSD is a solid buy. I’m pretty happy with it."

This thing is TINY. Additionally, it has a rubber-like coating on it that makes it easy to grip. Very sturdy but insanely light as well.

Included a picture of it compared to an iPhone 14 Pro Max, I was not expecting it to be so small (ordered it online) but was very pleased! I use it for RAW camera backups while I'm out on photo shoots and it has never given me an issue."
